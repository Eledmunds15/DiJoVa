    "## Step 3: Filtering Atomistic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we have the dataset, we can start filtering out atoms. One way to do this is to find atoms of higher energy in the dataset and isolate them. Thats what the filter_atoms() function does. It takes the original atomic dataset and filters atoms out based on two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Potential Energy (c_thresh)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dislocations are a line-based defect characterised by a misalignment of atomic planes in crystals. The misalignment of these atomic planes produce strain, as there are irregularities in the crystal structure. Because of this, atoms at the dislocation core (near to where the misalingment is) have a higher potential energy than that of atoms in a unaffected region of the crystal. c_thresh is the threshold energy that we assume when filtering atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Distance from the middle Z-axis of the simulation box\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous LAMMPS minimizations, we had fixed boundary conditions holidng atoms around the cylinder (along the x and y axis). This is necessary because of the way that LAMMPS works. By having fixed atoms at the edge of the simulation cylinder, we create high energy atoms but these are not atoms that we are interested in because they are an artefact of the limitations of this LAMMPS simulation procedure. Therefore we need to exclude them from our filtered dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have applied the filter_atoms() function to the original dataset, yielding a 'dislocation_df' dataframe. This is a dataframe contianing information about atoms in our dislocation. Also, to check that our dataset is okay, we can use the previous 3D scatter plot function to plot the dislocation. Ideally, you should see a line of atoms in the middle of the simulation cell. If you see a ring of atoms around the outside, you need to reduce the 'radius' parameter. If the dislocation looks really thick, then you need to reduce the c_thresh parameter."
